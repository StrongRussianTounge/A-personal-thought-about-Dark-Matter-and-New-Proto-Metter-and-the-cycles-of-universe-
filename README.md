Might be a wild topic!
I want to make it clear right away: I’m not a physicist, not an astrophysicist, not even a student of science. I’m just a regular guy with only a school-level education. But recently I had an idea that felt worth sharing. It may be wrong, it may be pure imagination, but maybe it will spark some thought.

Proto-Matter Before the Big Bang

What if proto-matter already existed before the Big Bang?

Instead of imagining a singularity out of nowhere, picture proto-matter as a fundamental state of reality. At some point, it underwent a reaction similar to thermonuclear fusion in stars — but on a universal scale. This reaction gave birth to hydrogen, and from hydrogen, the other elements formed.

Proto-matter would have to be lighter than hydrogen — lighter than anything else we know. This might explain why it escapes all our tools and remains invisible.

The Role of Dark Matter

So where does dark matter fit in?

I imagine dark matter as also lighter than hydrogen, but not as light as proto-matter. Or maybe dark matter has just a very tiny mass. Another possibility is that dark matter itself has zero mass, while protomatter actually carries a form of negative mass. This idea could make even more sense within the framework of the theory, because negative mass would naturally create the kind of repulsive gravitational effect needed to stretch space between galaxies. Its main property is accumulation: it gathers and slightly amplifies gravity inside galaxies. It interacts with gravity, but not as strongly as normal matter does.

Dark matter, together with ordinary matter, falls into black holes. But instead of being lost forever, it is processed. Inside a black hole, dark matter and any matter transform into proto-matter.

And proto-matter doesn’t stay trapped. It flows out of black holes like water, spreading through the universe, stretching space itself.
Think of it while dark matter fuels gravity locally and proto-matter drives expansion globally.

Expansion, Collapse, and Cycles

If proto-matter is constantly flowing out of black holes and stretching space, then cosmic expansion is not random. It is a direct effect of proto-matter filling the universe.

But stretching is only one side of the story. Like a rubber band, what stretches can also contract. Over unimaginable timescales, proto-matter might pull everything back, collapsing the universe into a single point — only for the cycle to begin again with another Big Bang.

Distorting Gravity

Finally, I wonder if proto-matter doesn’t just expand space, but also distorts gravity itself. Just as black holes bend space, proto-matter could bend gravity in the opposite way. This is basically a consequence of the fact that protomatter has no real mass. If there is no mass, then the more of this mass-less substance exists, the stronger the distortion of gravity becomes. In a way, the absence of mass makes gravity itself act like a kind of anti-gravity between galaxies. But inside galaxies, this effect is balanced or “shielded” by dark matter, which holds them together.

Around supermassive black holes, which anchor galaxies, halos of proto-matter might not pull inward but instead push galaxies apart. This could explain why galaxies are not collapsing together, but drifting away across the cosmos.

Closing Thought

I know this is just speculation. I’m not presenting equations or data, only an idea. But I find it fascinating to imagine proto-matter, dark matter, and as two hidden players in the story of the universe:
	•	dark matter holding galaxies together,
	•	proto-matter stretching the universe outward,
	•	and both working in cycles of expansion and collapse.

Maybe it’s wrong. Maybe it’s impossible. But still — it’s fun to think about. And yes, unfortunately, I don’t know English well enough to fully describe my idea. I asked that chat—you know which one—to help me translate it. Thanks everyone for your attention, I hope this guy from the Russian countryside made you stop and think for a moment!
